About Me

I am a full-stack data scientist with a passion for translating complex data insights into actionable solutions. My expertise spans the entire machine learning lifecycle, from data acquisition and cleaning to model deployment and ongoing maintenance.

On the data engineering side, I have experience building robust data pipelines using technologies like Spark and Kafka, and working with both SQL and NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB). I am proficient in cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure, and have experience with ETL processes.

My machine learning skillset includes developing and deploying models using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. I am familiar with a variety of algorithms, including regression, classification, and clustering, and utilize model serving tools for scalable deployment.

I also possess strong front-end development skills, with experience in creating interactive visualizations and user interfaces using Streamlit and Dash, alongside core web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I have contributed to projects involving [mention project areas like fraud detection, customer churn prediction, or image recognition], demonstrating my ability to apply data science principles to real-world problems. I am a dedicated problem-solver with a commitment to delivering impactful results.
